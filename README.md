# Noah's Dotfiles
My dotfiles for configuring vim, kitty, and zsh
## Requirements
These are the tools I use with this setup. Not all of them are required.
- neovim
- vim-plug
- tmux
- gopls
- solc (version must be at least 0.8.11 for lsp support)

## Setup
- pull these dotfiles into your home directory
- add `source .zsh_nvim` into `.zshrc`
